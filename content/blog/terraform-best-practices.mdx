# Terraform Best Practices for Scale

Learn how to structure and maintain large Terraform codebases effectively.

## Module Organization

Organize your Terraform modules hierarchically for maximum reusability:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/networking/vpc"
  
  environment = var.environment
  cidr_block  = var.vpc_cidr
  
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Terraform   = "true"
  }
}
```

## State Management

Always use remote state with proper locking:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use workspaces for environment separation
2. Implement proper state locking
3. Version your modules
4. Use consistent naming conventions
